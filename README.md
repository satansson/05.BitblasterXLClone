# BitblasterXLClone

This is a udemy project from Denis Panjuta's course 'Complete C# Unity Developer: Create Games and Learn to Code' which I've started on October 8 2020.
Then I changed my focus to Unity's courses 'Unity Essentials Pathway' and 'Junior Prigrammer' and it was worth it!
Now I continue the first one with some different (and critical) vision that allows me to do the things as I want and not just repeat after 'the teacher'.
The project was finished if martch 2021.

In this project I applyed:
- Object pooling;
- Statics;
- Singleton, etc.
